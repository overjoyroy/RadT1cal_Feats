# RadT1cal_Feats

RadT1cal_Feats is a pipeline designed to preprocess T1-weighted (T1w) Structural MRIs for visualization and further analysis. This tool extracts radiomics features for each region of interest (ROI) based on a provided anatomical atlas. It is intended for command-line use.

## Overview

The preprocessing pipeline includes four primary steps:

1. **Reorientation** - Aligning the MRI images to a standard orientation.
2. **Skull Stripping** - Removing non-brain tissues from the MRI images.
3. **Bias Correction** - Correcting intensity non-uniformities in the MRI images.
4. **Registration** - Aligning an atlas to the patient space for standardized anatomical referencing.
5. **Radiomics** - Calculating and collecting first order radiomics features per ROI

## Features

- Written primarily in Python.
- Utilizes the Nipype library for workflow management.
- Employs tools such as FSL and ANTs for processing tasks.
- Compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) Standard.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
At minimum:
- **Parent Data Directory**: The directory containing the MRI data.
- **Subject ID**: Identifier for the subject/patient.
- **Output Directory**: Directory where the processed outputs will be saved.

### Outputs

1. **Preprocessed Patient T1 MRI**: The MRI after all preprocessing steps.
2. **Atlas in Patient Space**: An atlas registered to the patientâ€™s anatomical space.
3. **Radiomics Features**: Radiomics features per ROI

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Tool Directly

To use this tool directly, run the following command:
```
python3 t1_preproc.py -p [data_dir_path] -sid [subject-id] -o [output_path] -tem [template_path] -seg [segment_path]
```

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Using Docker is recommended to simplify the installation of necessary dependencies (including FSL, ANTs, and relevant Python libraries). There are two ways to use Docker: building and running the container locally, or using a prebuilt Docker image from Docker Hub.

**Option 1: Building and Running the Container Locally**
1. Clone the Git repository and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile.
2. Build the Docker container:
```
docker build -t my_RadT1cal_Feats_container .
```
3. Run the Docker container:
```
docker run -v [data_dir_path]:/data/my_data -v [output_path]:/data/output --rm -u $UID:$UID my_RadT1cal_Feats_container -p /data/my_data -sid [subject-id] -o [output_path] 
```

Explanation of Docker Flags:

```--rm```: Automatically removes the container after it exits. <br>
```-v```: Mounts your data and output directories into the Docker container.<br>
```-u``` $UID:$UID: Runs the Docker container as the same user as on the host machine to avoid file permission issues.

*Notes:
If the output directory is a subdirectory of the data directory (e.g., \[data_dir_path\]/derivatives), you only need to mount the data directory once and provide the output path relative to the mounted data directory (e.g., /data/my_data/derivatives). Output files will be accessible on the host machine from where the output path was mounted. Default anatomical templates and atlas (MNI152 and AALv3_CombinedThalami respectively) are included so the -tem and -seg flags are optional.*

**Option 2: Using a Prebuilt Docker Image**
1. Pull the prebuilt Docker image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull jor115/RadT1cal_Feats
```
2. Run the Docker container using the pulled image:
```
docker run -v [data_dir_path]:/data/my_data -v [output_path]:/data/output --rm -u $UID:$UID my_RadT1cal_Feats_container -p /data/my_data -sid [subject-id] -o [output_path] 
```
*Note: The docker run command is identical to the one used for running a locally built container, but you do not need to download the source code or build the container locally.*

## Development Status

This tool is a work in progress. It is currently fully functional but is undergoing refinement to enhance user flexibility and input handling.
